### 12-Lead Imbalanced ECG Beat Classification Using Time Series ResNet

This repository contains supplementary materials from a research project for classifying ECG beat segments into diagnostic classes decined in PhysioBank.
Thus far, the following materials have been uploaded.
1. A full 12 lead ECG segments of an RBBB beat from the original ECG data set.
2. A full 12 lead ECG segments of an RBBB beat randomly altered during ECG data augmentation.
3. Additional results detailing the training accuracy and test accuracy in ECG segment classification using augmented training and test datasets (scenario EXP1).
